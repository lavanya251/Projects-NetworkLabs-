            Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi ( 2 October 1869 â€“ 30 January 1948)Born
            and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in
            the law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at
            age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he
            was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South
            Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went
            on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here that Gandhi
            raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a
            campaign for civil rights.
